# Student Enrollment Form 

I have created a student Form using JsonPowerDb. It's contains field like Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date. You can enter data to required field and press 
save button to save the data to the database directly. You can also change or update the data by pressing change button.
